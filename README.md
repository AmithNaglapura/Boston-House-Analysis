> **"Does a river view actually add value?"** > This project moves beyond simple visualization to apply **rigorous statistical testing** and **data engineering** to the classic Boston Housing Dataset.

## 🎯 Project Overview
The goal was to identify the true drivers of property value (`MEDV`) in Boston. While many assume location is everything, this analysis uses Python to quantify the impact of room counts, socio-economic status, and river proximity.

### 🛠️ Key Technical Features
* [cite_start]**Data Engineering:** Handled `CRIM` outliers using the **IQR (Interquartile Range) Method**[cite: 5].
* [cite_start]**Feature Scaling:** Standardized numerical features using `StandardScaler` for model readiness[cite: 5].
* [cite_start]**Statistical Rigor:** Conducted an **Independent T-Test** to validate the impact of the Charles River (`CHAS`)[cite: 5].
* [cite_start]**Correlation Mapping:** Identified `RM` (Rooms) and `LSTAT` (Status) as the primary price drivers[cite: 5].

## 📊 Visual Gallery

### 1. The Value Drivers (Correlation Matrix)
By using a heatmap, we can clearly see the strong positive correlation between rooms and price, and the heavy inverse relationship with lower-status population density.

### 2. Room Count vs. Market Value
A regression analysis shows a clear linear trend: more rooms generally equal higher value, though we see interesting "caps" at the \$50k mark.

### 3. The "River Effect" (Statistical Significance)
Our T-Test confirms that proximity to the Charles River is statistically significant ($p < 0.05$). The boxplot below highlights the higher median value for "River-bound" properties.

## 🧪 Statistical Results
| Test | Metric | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **T-Statistic** | `3.9964` | Significant |
| **P-Value** | `0.0001` | **Reject Null Hypothesis** |
| **Conclusion** | Proximity to River | **Strong Impact on Price** |

## 📈 Conclusion & Future Work
This analysis confirms that while environmental factors like the Charles River provide a premium, structural features (number of rooms) and socio-economic context remain the most powerful predictors of Boston real estate prices.

**Next Steps for this Project:**
* **Machine Learning:** Implement a Random Forest Regressor to see if non-linear models improve price prediction.
* **Feature Selection:** Use Lasso Regression to programmatically identify and remove redundant features.
* **External Data:** Integrate modern 2026 interest rate data to see how market dynamics have shifted since this original study.
